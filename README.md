# It Follows

This little game is made for the final exercise of the Advanced Course in Programming from Helsinki University MOOC using PyGame library. 

The goal of the game is simple: Collect all the coins without getting caught by the ghoul. Here is a little gameplay video:

The player controls the robot with arrow keys and when they touch a coin, it's removed from the screen and the score increments by one. The ghoul appears after collecting the first coin and follows the robot wherever it goes. To make the game a little more challenging, ghoul speeds up after the third one. Depending of the result, there are "Victory" and "Game over" messages at the end of the game. The game can be restarted and quitted with F2 and ESC keys respectively.
